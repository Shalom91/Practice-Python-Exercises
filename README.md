Exercise 1 : Character Input

Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

Exercise 2 : Odd or Even

Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

Exercise 3 : List Less Than 5

Take a list, say for example this one:
  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

Exercise 4 : Divisors

Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

Exercise 5 : List Comprehension

Write a one-line program that takes a list and makes a new list of only even elements
